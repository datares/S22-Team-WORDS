# Team WORDS
Analyzing the best strategies in order to beat Wordle in the least words as possible. 

We used a dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bcruise/wordle-valid-words that included every single possible 5 letter word, and every single possible Wordle word, with the intention of finding patterns in letter positions, discovering which letters may have a high chance of a duplicate, and even finding the best first, second, and third words to use when playing Wordle.
